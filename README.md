# LostFoundStolen Treasure

## ::Game Description::

Everyone is searching for lost treasure which is a gold blink in the middle.
Whoever surrounds the gold with the most blinks wins.
Players click their blinks and secretly set it to a number from 1 to 6.
Players then double click their blink to go to their set color and hide what number they chose.
When everyone has chosen a number they attach their blinks to the gold blink. 
Your blink stays attached and is worth the value of the points you selected - but only if nobody else chose that value.

Play 3 rounds or until the blink fills up. Once you have attached your blink you are done. Whoever attaches the highest number wins after three rounds, or if a player plays a 6 by themselves they win.

For example in a 5p game.

</br> Player 1 chooses 6
</br> Player 2 chooses          5
</br> Player 3 chooses          5
</br> Player 4 chooses          6
</br> Player 5 chooses           5

Nobody gets to place their blink because everyone was too greedy and there are only two rounds left

Round 2 of a 5p game
</br> Player 1 chooses 4
</br> Player 2 chooses 6
</br> Player 3 chooses 1
</br> Player 4 chooses 4
</br> Player 5 chooses 6

Player 3's blink stays attached with one pie showing they were the only one that chose 1. In the next round nobody can choose 1 because.

In round 3 whoever chooses the highest number without someone else choosing it wins the game. If nobody comes up with a unique number then player three wins with 1 point.
