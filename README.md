# Bandits
## ::Game Description::

You lead a band of Bandits going up against other gangs, looting the same lost diamonds. Everyone rushes to the loot but only one team can sneak away with it each round. You can steal diamonds from opposing teams, but watch out because once you steal you put everyone in greater danger of theft.

Each round all players (2-6 players) determine their secret number between 1 & 5, then place one Bandit Blink on one of the 6 playable faces. Tap the Treasure Blink to calculate who wins the round. You win if you have the highest unique number compared to the other teams. If there are no unique numbers (everyone picks 5 for example) then nobody wins that round.

The highest unique number wins the roung, but if a 1 is played a 5 cannot win.
Score points based on how low your winning number is.  Round Score = 6 - winning number.
You cannot play the same secret number two rounds in a row.  After just losing with a 5 you can only use 1-4 next turn, but can use 5 again after that
Steal 1 from every other Bandit in the chain but not from yourself. You cannot steal from a Bandit w/ 0, but you always win the point total for your secret number played.

Hold a Blink to cycle through team colors and use as Bandit Blink.
4x click one Blink to designate it as the first Treasure Blink.
Players click their Bandit Blink to secretly set it to a number from 1 to 6.
Then double click the Bandit Blink to light all faces and hide the chosen number.
When everyone has chosen a number for the round, players attach their Bandit Blink to one of the 6 playable faces. 
Single click the/a Treasure Blink to calculate who wins the round.
Your Bandit Blink becomes a Treasure Blink with one face marking your team color for scoring.  


For example in a 5 player game with 9 blinks:

</br> Player 1 chooses 5
</br> Player 2 chooses          5
</br> Player 3 chooses          5
</br> Player 4 chooses          4
</br> Player 5 chooses          4

Nobody wins and all removed their Bandit from the Treasure blink

Round 2
</br> Player 1 chooses 4
</br> Player 2 chooses 4
</br> Player 3 chooses 4
</br> Player 4 chooses 5
</br> Player 5 chooses 3

Player 4 wins, and their Bandit stays attached to Treasure blink with 1 face lit becuase they score 1 point on that Bandit for this round.

Round 3
</br> Player 1 chooses 5
</br> Player 2 chooses 3
</br> Player 3 chooses 3
</br> Player 4 chooses 3
</br> Player 5 chooses 1

Player 5 wins, and their Bandit stays attached to Treasure blink with 5 faces lit because they score 5 points on that Bandit for this round.

Round 4
</br> Player 1 chooses 4
</br> Player 2 chooses 5
</br> Player 3 chooses 5
</br> Player 4 chooses 3
</br> Player 5 chooses 2

Player 1 wins, and their Bandit stays attached to Player 5's blink with 2 faces lit because they score 2 points on that Bandit for this round. Player 5's blink loses 1 and now has 4 faces lit.

Round 5
</br> Player 1 chooses 2
</br> Player 2 chooses 3
</br> Player 3 chooses 1
</br> Player 4 chooses 2
</br> Player 5 chooses 5

Player 2 wins, and their Bandit stays attached to Player 1's blink with 3 faces lit because they score 3 points on that Bandit for this round. Player 5's blink loses 1 and now has 3 faces lit. Player 1's blink loses 1 and now has 2 faces lit.

Since Bandit blink pile was empty at the start of this round (there's 5 players and 4 blinks not attached to Treasure) the game is over.
Player 5 and 2 tie with 3 points, tie breakers are number of Bandits on original Treasure so player 5 wins.  Second tie breaker is # of total Bandits attached to Treasure cluster.
