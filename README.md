# Lost Found & Stolen

## ::Game Description::

You lead a gang of bandits going up against other gangs, searching searching for the same lost treasure. Everyone rushes to the loot but only one team can sneak away with it. Each round all players (2-6 players) determine their secret number between 1 & 6, then place one Bandit Blink on the Treasure Blink. Tap the Treasure Blink to calculate who wins the roung and if you have the highest unique number compared to the other teams, you win that round. If there are no unique numbers (everyone picks 5 for example) then nobody wins that round.

Hold a Blink to cycle through team colors and use as Bandit Blink.
Triple click one Blink to designate it as the first Treasure Blink.
Players click their Bandit Blink to secretly set it to a number from 1 to 6.
Then double click the Bandit Blink to light all faces and hide the chosen number.
When everyone has chosen a number for the round, players attach their Bandit Blink to the Treasure Blink. 
Single click the/a Treasure Blink to calculate who wins the round.
Your Bandit Blink becomes a Treasure Blink with one face marking your team color for scoring.  
The bunch of Treasure Blinks grows, giving more options but also more competition.


For example in a 5 player game.

</br> Player 1 chooses 6
</br> Player 2 chooses          5
</br> Player 3 chooses          5
</br> Player 4 chooses          6
</br> Player 5 chooses           5

Nobody gets to place their blink because everyone was too greedy and there are only two rounds left

Round 2 of a 5p game
</br> Player 1 chooses 4
</br> Player 2 chooses 6
</br> Player 3 chooses 1
</br> Player 4 chooses 4
</br> Player 5 chooses 6

Player 3's blink stays attached with one pie showing they were the only one that chose 1. In the next round nobody can choose 1 because.

In round 3 whoever chooses the highest number without someone else choosing it wins the game. If nobody comes up with a unique number then player three wins with 1 point.
