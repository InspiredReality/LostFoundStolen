# Lost Found & Stolen

## ::Game Description::

You lead a gang of bandits going up against other gangs, searching searching for the same lost treasure. Everyone rushes to the loot but only one team can sneak away with it. Each round all players (2-6 players) determine their secret number between 1 & 6, then place one Bandit Blink on the Treasure Blink. Tap the Treasure Blink to calculate who wins the roung and if you have the highest unique number compared to the other teams, you win that round. If there are no unique numbers (everyone picks 5 for example) then nobody wins that round.

Players click their blinks and secretly set it to a number from 1 to 6.
Players then double click their blink to go to their set color and hide what number they chose.
When everyone has chosen a number they attach their blinks to the gold blink. 
Your blink stays attached and is worth the value of the points you selected - but only if nobody else chose that value.

Play 3 rounds or until the blink fills up. Once you have attached your blink you are done. Whoever attaches the highest number wins after three rounds, or if a player plays a 6 by themselves they win.


For example in a 5p game.

</br> Player 1 chooses 6
</br> Player 2 chooses          5
</br> Player 3 chooses          5
</br> Player 4 chooses          6
</br> Player 5 chooses           5

Nobody gets to place their blink because everyone was too greedy and there are only two rounds left

Round 2 of a 5p game
</br> Player 1 chooses 4
</br> Player 2 chooses 6
</br> Player 3 chooses 1
</br> Player 4 chooses 4
</br> Player 5 chooses 6

Player 3's blink stays attached with one pie showing they were the only one that chose 1. In the next round nobody can choose 1 because.

In round 3 whoever chooses the highest number without someone else choosing it wins the game. If nobody comes up with a unique number then player three wins with 1 point.
